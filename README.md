# HIIT Timer

A simple Progressive Web App for timing HIIT workouts. Made with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) and bootstrapped by [create-elm-app](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

I also toyed around with the file structure, separating them into `Data`, `Modules`, and `View` with increasing modularity. Not sure how viable this is, though.

## Demo

You can see it in action [here](https://joshuaji.com/projects/hiit-timer/)

## Run It Urself

Make sure you have Elm and create-elm-app installed. Once you `git clone` the repo, run `elm-app start` to open the development server with the cool debug feature.

`elm-app build` also builds the project in the `build` folder (which I gitignored).
