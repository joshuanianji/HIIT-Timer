# HIIT Timer

A simple Progressive Web App for timing HIIT workouts, created from the frustration of having to pay for simple timer apps online. Compatible with mobile and desktop. Made with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) and [create-elm-app](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).


## Demo 

You can see it in action [here](https://joshuaji.com/projects/hiit-timer/)

## Run It Yourself

Make sure you have Elm and create-elm-app installed. Once you `git clone` the repo, run `elm-app start` to open the development server with the cool debug feature.

`elm-app build` also builds the project in the `build` folder (which I gitignored).
