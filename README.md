# HIIT Timer

A simple app for timing hiit workouts, because my sister has to pAY for a stupid HIIT workout app on her phone?? It's literally a timer?? Anyway mine is better than any apps you find online ;)). Made with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org).


## Demo 

You can see it in action [here](https://joshuaji.com/projects/hiit-timer/)

## Run It Yourself

Make sure you have Elm and create-elm-app installed. Once you `git clone` the repo, run `elm-app start` to open the development server with the cool debug feature.

`elm-app build` also builds the project in the `build` folder (which I gitignored).
